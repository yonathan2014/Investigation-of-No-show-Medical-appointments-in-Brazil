# Investigation-of-No-show-Medical-appointments-in-Brazil
This Repo contains files and analysis of a dataset containing information about medical appointments made in brazil.

## Dataset
> The dataset selected for analysis collects information from 100K medical appointments in Brazil. 

> It is mainly focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. The dataset includes different characteristics like the neighborhood, whether or not the patients are enrolled in the Brazilian social welfare program (Bolsa FamÃ­lia, which provided financial aid to poor Brazilian families), Age etc.

> We will be alalyzing whether these characteristics have an influence on whether or not a patient will be a no-show at the Medical appointment.

## Summary of Findings
> Although the number of female patients is nearly double the number of male patients, an even distibution of no-shows of 20%has been observed for both genders.

> The mean age of the patients who are a no-show to their appointments is 34.3 which is less than the average age of the patients (37). This shows younger patients tend to miss their appointments more than older patients.

> Around 20 percent of patients miss their appointments (are a no-show).

> The patients who received sms messages tend to miss appointments (27% no show rate) more than those who didn't receive text messages (17% no show rate).

> There is an even distribution (around 20%) of no shows for most of the neighbourhoods.

> The people who didn't receive scholarships and didn't receive sms messages showed up to their appointments more than those who were enrolled in the scholarship program and received sms messages.
